Cashew.js
======

Cashew.js is a work-in-progress MVC JavaScript library that tries to pull together some of the better parts of other JavaScript MVC libraries to create a small but efficient utility to organize your client-side applications. It aims to be something that has the following attributes...

* No Dependencies - But you're free to include whatever other libraries you want.
* Non-cryptic $yntaxes - Familiar look and feel to native JavaScript..
* Small and Lightweight - In the end, it woun't be an additional 200KB+ that you need to load into your page
* Non-opinionated when it matters - No AJAX calls made unless you specify that you want them made yourself.
.
And some other stuff as well...
